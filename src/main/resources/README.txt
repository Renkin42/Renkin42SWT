* ABOUT THIS VERSION *
**********************

Current Version: ${version}

My mods follow a simple and informative versioning system. The first number indicates the 
Minecraft version without the periods. The next number is the build of Minecraft Forge this
version was built against. I recommend using at least this version to ensure everything runs
smoothly. The third number is this mod's major version. It will go up if there have been
major fundamental changes, even if you can't see them. The last number is the minor version.
It is the most likely one to change on update, and simply indicates some sort of change. Only
direct ports will not result in this number staying the same.

*   INSTALL FORGE    *
**********************

1. Go to http://files.minecraftforge.net/ and download the latest recommended 'installer' 
	version for this version of minecraft. See above for details on the Minecraft and Forge
	versions you need.
2. Run the downloaded .jar file. If it opens on WinRAR or 7zip, close it and right click
	it. Choose 'Open With' and select 'Java Platform SE Binary'. Make sure "Install Client"
	is selected and hit 'OK'. Forge will now be automatically installed as a new profile in
	the Minecraft Launcher.

**********************
*    INSTALL MOD     *
**********************

1. Open your Minecraft Launcher and select the 'Forge' profile. Click the 'Edit Profile'
	button. Here click the check box next to 'Game Directory' and copy the path by
	highlighting the text in the box and hitting Ctrl(Command)+C on your keyboard. Now click
	'Cancel'.
2. Open your file explorer and paste the path you just copied in the address bar and hit 
	Enter(Return). This should bring you to your .minecraft folder. It might be a good idea to
	create a shortcut to this location for later use.
3. Open the 'mods' folder. If there isn't one, go ahead and create it. Copy and paste this 
	.jar file into that folder. Now close your file explorer, start Minecraft, and enjoy!
