Renkin42SWT
===========

This is the source code of a mod for Minecraft Forge which primarily adds a variety of throwable items to the game, among other things. For more details, see one of these pages:

[Minecraft Forums Page][mcf] | [Curse(Download) Page][curse]

This source code is provided primarily as a resource to fellow modders, though I also use the code as a starting point to ask others for help, as I am by no means an experienced modder. Please be aware that for versions prior to 1.7, the file structure of this repository is not accurate. 1.6 and 1.5 did not use a src/main/java and /resources setup. I've simply done this so changes are visible across versions.

How can I Help?
---------------

My biggest need right now is translated .lang files. However, any code improvements are greatly appreciated. This repository should be ready to clone to a Forge Gradle installation, but you're on your own as far as how to accomplish that. 

The lang files, though, can be done right here in GitHub. Just fork this repository and switch to the "unreleased" branch. Then, navigate to "src/main/resources/assets/renkin42swt/lang". Here create a new file called something like aa_BB.lang. You can get the correct name from [here][lang-codes]. Copy the contents of en_US.lang into this file, edit it, and commit. Then simply issue a Pull Request and I'll handle it from there.
